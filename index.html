          <h1>Mad Libs Origin</h1>
          <p>
            "Mad Libs was invented in 1953 by Leonard Stern and Roger Price.
            Stern and Price co-created the game, but could not agree on a name
            for their invention. No name was chosen until five years later
            (1958), when Stern and Price were eating Eggs Benedict at a
            restaurant in New York City. While eating, the two overheard an
            argument at a neighboring table between a talent agent and an actor.
            According to Price and Stern, during the overheard argument, the
            actor said that he wanted to "ad-lib" an upcoming interview. The
            agent, who clearly disagreed with the actor's suggestion, retorted
            that ad-libbing an interview would be "mad". Stern and Price used
            that eavesdropped conversation to create, at length, the name "Mad
            Libs"." <br />(Sourced from
